					<h1>Chef</h1>
					<h3>Infrastructure automation</h3>
					<p>
						<small>Presented by <a href="http://mauricioaraya.net">Mauricio Araya V.</a> / <a href="http://twitter.com/mabrizio">@mabrizio</a></small>

				<section>
					<h2>What is chef?</h2>
					<p>
						Chef turns infrastructure into code. With Chef, you can automate how you build, deploy, and manage your infrastructure. Your infrastructure becomes as versionable, testable, and repeatable as application code.
					</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<section>
						<h2>Chef Components</h2>
						<img width="55%" height="55%" src="chef_overview.png">
					</section>
				</section>

				
				<section>
					<h2>Chef Client</h2>
					<p>
						A chef-client is installed on every node that is under management by Chef. The chef-client performs all of the configuration tasks that are specified by the run-list and will pull down any required configuration data from the Chef server as it is needed during the chef-client run.
					</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Workstation</h2>
					<p>
						One (or more) workstations are configured to allow users to author, test, and maintain cookbooks. Cookbooks are uploaded to the Chef server from the workstation.
					</p>
				</section>


				<section>
					<h2>Chef Server</h2>
					<p>
						The Chef server acts as a hub of information. Cookbooks and policy settings are uploaded to the Chef server by users from workstations.
					</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Ohai</h2>
					<p>
						Ohai is a tool that is used to detect attributes on a node, and then provide these attributes to the chef-client at the start of every chef-client run. Ohai is required by the chef-client and must be present on a node.
					</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Data Bag</h2>
					<p>
						A data bag is a global variable that is stored as JSON data and is accessible from a Chef server. A data bag is indexed for searching and can be loaded by a recipe or accessed during a search.
					</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Run List</h2>
					<p>
						A run-list defines all of the configuration settings that are necessary for a node that is under management by Chef to be put into the desired state.
					</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Roles</h2>
					<p>
						A role is a way to define certain patterns and processes that exist across nodes in an organization as belonging to a single job function. Each role consists of zero (or more) attributes and a run-list.
					</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Environments</h2>
					<p>
						An environment is a way to map an organizationâ€™s real-life workflow to what can be configured and managed when using Chef server.
					</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Cookbooks</h2>
					<p>
						An attribute can be defined in a cookbook (or a recipe) and then used to override the default settings on a node. When a cookbook is loaded during a chef-client run, these attributes are compared to the attributes that are already present on the node.
					</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Versions</h2>
					<p>
						A cookbook version represents a set of functionality that is different from the cookbook on which it is based. A version may exist for many reasons, such as ensuring the correct use of a third-party component, updating a bug fix, or adding an improvement.
					</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Recipe</h2>
					<p>
 						A recipe is the most fundamental configuration element within the organization.  A recipe:
 						<ul>
 							<li>Authored using Ruby.</li>
 							<li>Mostly a collection of resources, defined using patterns.</li>
 							<li>Must be stored in a cookbook.</li>
 							<li>May be included in a recipe.</li>
 						</ul>
					</p>
				</section>


				<section>
					<h2>Recipe Attributes</h2>
					<p>
 						An attribute can be defined in a cookbook (or a recipe) and then used to override the default settings on a node. When a cookbook is loaded during a chef-client run, these attributes are compared to the attributes that are already present on the node. Attributes that are defined in attribute files are first loaded according to cookbook order.
					</p>
				</section>


				<section>
					<h2>Data Bags</h2>
					<p>
 						A data bag is a global variable that is stored as JSON data and is accessible from a Chef server. A data bag is indexed for searching and can be loaded by a recipe or accessed during a search.
					</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Data Bags</h2>
					<pre><code data-trim contenteditable>
{
  "id": "my_app",
  "repository": "git://github.com/company/my_app.git"
}
					</code></pre>
					<pre><code data-trim contenteditable>
my_bag = data_bag_item("apps", "my_app")
my_bag["repository"]
					</code></pre>
				</section>


				<section>
					<h2>Knife</h2>
					<p>
 						command-line tool that provides an interface between a local chef-repo and the Chef server. It helps to manage:
 						<ul>
 							<li>Nodes.</li>
 							<li>Cookbooks and recipes.</li>
 							<li>Roles.</li>
 							<li>Environments.</li>
 							<li>Searching of indexed data.</li>
 						</ul>
					</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Knife</h2>
					<p>
					<pre><code data-trim contenteditable>
$ knife node list
$ knife client list
$ knife node show node.fqdn
$ knife environment list
$ knife cookbook list
					</code></pre>
					</p>
				</section>


				<section>
					<h1>Let's give it a try</h1>
				</section>


				<section>
					<h2>Server setup</h2>
					<p> 						
 						<ul>
 							<li>Update/Upgrade your packages</li>
                                                        <li>Server running ubuntu</li>
 							<li>Install Apache</li>
 							<li>Install PHP</li>
 							<li>Deploy a hello world app</li>
 						</ul>
